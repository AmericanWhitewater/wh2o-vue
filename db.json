They are located on the river left and river right side of the river where it passes Tunxis Ave. They can be safely navigated down the center of the river, or for a more challenging and bumpy ride, on the river right side.

The piece of the dam that sits 40 yards downstream of the outflow of the flume is called Car Rock (the larger piece of the dam next to it is called Aircraft Carrier). This rock was also the site of a fatality when an individual unfamiliar with whitewater, and lacking proper whitewater equipment including a PFD, pinned underwater and perished.
