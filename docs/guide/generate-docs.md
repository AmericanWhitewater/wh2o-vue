# Generate Docs

## Requirements

- [docgen](https://github.com/thedevsaddam/docgen)
- [postman](https://www.postman.com/)

Generating endpoint documentation is a multi-step process. All endpoints are documented in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). There is a tracked postman collection available at `wh2o-api/docs/wh2o-api.postman_collection.json`. You can import the JSON into Postman and use it as a starting point. 

When you're ready to publish your endpoint docs, export the wh2o-api collection from Postman to `wh2o-api/docs/wh2o-api.postman_collection.json`. Then from the project root run: `npm run docs:postman`. This will generate a new README.md file in the docs/endpoints directory. Remove the Table of Contents (TOC) generated by docgen as they don't work in Vuepress.

In addition to removing the TOC, we'll also want to remove the footer and back-to-top prompt generated by docgen. This will help keep the docs content/branding consistent. Many thanks to [thedevsaddam](https://github.com/thedevsaddam) for making such an awesome tool.
