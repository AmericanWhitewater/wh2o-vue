# Writing Docs

We use [`Vuepress`](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for our documentation. 

To write docs, cd to the project root and run `npm run docs:dev`. This will bring up the documentation site with hot reloading.

All working documentation files are in the `docs/` directory.

## Production

To build the app for production run `npm run docs:build`. Static files will be outputted in `docs/.vuepress/dist/`.
