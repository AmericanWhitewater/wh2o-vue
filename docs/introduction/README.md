# Introduction

Welcome! [American Whitewater](https://www.americanwhitewater.org/) (AW) is a national non-profit and is the primary advocate for the preservation and protection of whitewater rivers throughout the United States. We connect the interests of human-powered recreational river users with ecological and science-based data to achieve goals within our mission.

This site is the technical documentation for [`wh2o-vue`](https://github.com/AmericanWhitewater/wh2o-vue), an interactive whitewater river map and guide which provides flow data, descriptions, safety information, and more for the ~6000 (and growing!) rivers  in the AW database.

If you're looking to contribute to the project, visit the [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started.md) section in [Guides](/guide/).
