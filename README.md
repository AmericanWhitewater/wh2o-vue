American Whitewater is a national non-profit and is the primary advocate for the preservation and protection of whitewater rivers throughout the United States and connects the interests of human-powered recreational river users with ecological and science-based data to achieve goals within our mission.

This app is an interactive whitewater river map and guide which provides flow data, descriptions, safety information, and more for the ~6000 rivers in the American Whitewater database.
